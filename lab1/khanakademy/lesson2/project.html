        <h2>The most rewarding trip is one that gives back </h2>
        
        <p>
            The Hawaiian Islands itinerary that can change your life isn’t found in any guidebooks. Because what makes the Hawaiian Islands truly special is not only our stunning natural beauty or our vibrant culture - it’s the deeply rooted relationship that connects them.<br> 
 <br>
That relationship between people and place grows stronger every time you mālama (give back). When you give back - to the land, the ocean, the wildlife, the forest, the fishpond, the community - you’re part of a virtuous circle that enriches everything and everyone. Including your experience as a visitor. <br>
 <br>
Several organizations offer opportunities for visitors to pay it forward, like beach clean-ups, native tree planting, and more. Engage in some of our volunteer opportunities below, and in exchange, experience Hawaiʻi on a much deeper and connected level. Through the Mālama Hawaiʻi Program, you could qualify for a special discount or even a free night from a participating hotel when participating in its dedicated volunteer activity
